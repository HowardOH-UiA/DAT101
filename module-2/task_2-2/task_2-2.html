      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				If you need to change a variable during the programs runtime, it cannot be a constant.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Like in math, parentheses can change the order of a calculation, which can lead to a desired result.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				"ToString" can limit a variable to a certain amount of decimals.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				An id/else function get compare which of the objects are bigger or if they are the same size.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				It returns a boolean, which can be checked in an if statement, or in the console.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				If you need something to be as close to random as possible. It always returns a number between 1 and 0.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				It divides to values and returns the "extra" that could not be divided.
